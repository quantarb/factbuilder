# Agents App

The `agents` app leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in generating and managing facts. It acts as a bridge between natural language user intent and the structured world of facts.

## Main Interfaces

### Models

*   **`TaxonomyProposal`**: Represents a proposal generated by an LLM to create a new fact. It includes the proposed logic, schema, test cases, and feasibility analysis.
*   **`CapabilitySuggestion`**: Stores suggestions for new capabilities or questions the system could answer.

### Core Logic

*   **`llm_service.py`**: Handles interactions with the LLM provider.
*   **`TaxonomyProposal.approve()`**: A key method that promotes a proposal into a concrete `FactDefinition` and `FactDefinitionVersion` in the `facts` app. It performs validation (dependencies, schema, tests) before creation.

## Contract

*   **Proposal Lifecycle**: Proposals start as 'pending', can be 'approved' (creating a fact), or 'rejected'.
*   **Validation**: The app ensures that proposed logic is valid Python or expression code and that it passes generated test cases before being integrated into the system.
